Start the server:

  ruby -rubygems server.rb

Then point your browser at:

  http://localhost:3000/index.html

and click the link.

This will send an AJAX request to the server, which in turn returns JSON
encoded data. This JSON data is converted to a RubyJS data structure
which is actually the same as the data structure that is converted to
JSON on the server side (in this example: [{'Hello' => 'World!'}],
i.e. an Array that contains a Hash). Then, the #inspect method is called
for this data structure, which returns a String representation of that
data structure, actually the same as you'd get when you call #inspect
in a regular Ruby application.
